> Five heads are better than one.

**Hello there!** <br>
Here we are, five people from different lines of work, gathered together to create useful tools and apps. <br>
To know us better, that's who we are :
- A front-end developer, who knows a lot about react, javascript, node, HTML, and css.
- An embedded programmer, who loves Rust and low-level code.
- A C++ developer who also knows PHP very well
- A purple teamer, who makes sure everything is secure, and also helps all of us
- And finally, a Zig programmer who is fond of Linux and low-level programming.
<br>
And, as you can see, we basically can do anything we put our minds into!<br>
Not because of our expertise, but because we are like a family.
